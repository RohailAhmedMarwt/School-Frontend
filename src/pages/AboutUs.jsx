            Introduction & School History

            "The FF Center founded the school before the subcontinent was
            divided, setting the groundwork for its illustrious history of
            education and discipline. A new phase of growth and development
            began in 1976 when administrative responsibility was formally turned
            over to the Federal Government Educational Institutions
            (Cantt/Garrison). In 1984, the institution received a high school
            upgrade, demonstrating its expanding role in offering young people
            high-quality education.
            <br />
            <br />
            To meet its growing demands, the school moved to its current
            location in 1986 from its original location on Murree Road. In
            1992â€“1993, a purpose-designed campus with improved facilities and
            infrastructure was established, greatly enhancing the learning
            environment. The school was located on A-I land, which is an area of
            41 Kanals and 17 Marlas, from 1993 until 2015. However, the total
            size was reduced to the current 22 Kanals and 11 Marlas in January
            2016 when 19 Kanals and 6 Marlas of this land were handed to the
            Station Headquarters Abbottabad.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a solid academic reputation, committed professors, and a
            dedication to the complete development of students, the school
            thrives despite the loss of land. With its roots in tradition and
            its evolution to suit contemporary educational standards, the school
            is a shining example of high-quality education in the area."{" "}
